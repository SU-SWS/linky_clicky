Feature: Stanford Gallery
  In order to ensure that the Stanford Gallery Feature works.
  As all types of users
  I want to check for CRUD operations and supporting functionality.

  # Scenario: Viewing a featured image on the About page
  #   Given I am on "about"
  #   Then I should see "Arcade on the Quad" in the "Content Body" region
