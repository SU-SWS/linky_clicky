Feature: Javascript
  In order to ensure that the Undergrad website progressive enhancement is functional
  As an end user
  I want to interact with dynamic Javascript elements on the page

@javascript
Scenario: Homepage carousel
  Given I am on the homepage
  When I click "â€º" in the "Main Upper" region
  And I wait for AJAX to finish
  Then I should see "Ways of Thinking/Ways of Doing" in the "Main Upper" region
