Feature: Stanford CAP Extensible
  In order to ensure that upgrades do not break existing functionality
  As an administrative user
  I want to ensure that the Stanford CAP Extensible module is working properly

    Given the "stanford_capx" module is enabled
    Given I am logged in as a user with the "administrator" role
