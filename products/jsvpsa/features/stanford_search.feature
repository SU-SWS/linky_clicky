Feature: Stanford Search
  In order to ensure that the search functionality works.
  As an end user
  I want to use the search box to find content.

  # Scenario: Viewing a featured image on the About page
  #   Given I am on "about"
  #   Then I should see "Arcade on the Quad" in the "Content Body" region
