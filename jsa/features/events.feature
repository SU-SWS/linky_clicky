 In order to ensure that Jumpstart Academics events are viewable
 As an end user
 I want to check for the existence of events content

Scenario: See upcoming events on homepage
 Given I am on the homepage
 Then I should see the "Upcoming Events" heading in the "Content 3 column flow" region

Scenario: See upcoming events content
 Given I am on "events/upcoming-events"
 Then I should see a ".event-title" element

Scenario: See calendar nav block
 Given I am on "events/upcoming-events"
 Then I should see a ".date-nav-wrapper" element

Scenario: See past events - check for pager
 Given I am on "events/past-events"
 Then I should see 5 or fewer ".event-title" elements

Scenario: Searching events
 Given I am on "events/upcoming-events"
 When I select "Lecture" from "Filter by type"
 And I press the "Go" button
 Then I should see "Currently, no future events are scheduled" in the "Content Body" region
