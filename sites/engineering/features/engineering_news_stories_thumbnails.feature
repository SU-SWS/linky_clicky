  I want to be able to view thumbnails on news stories

  Scenario: Verify users can view the images on the faculty profiles
    Given I am on "news/recent-news"

    And I should see 1 or more ".view-content" elements
    And I should see 1 or more ".postcard-image" elements
    And I should see 1 or more ".postcard-content" elements
