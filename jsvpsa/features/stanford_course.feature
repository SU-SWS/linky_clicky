Feature: Stanford Courses
  In order to ensure that the Stanford course content type and supporting functionality works.
  As an end user and administrator
  I want to check for both the creation and display of the course content.

  # Scenario: Viewing a featured image on the About page
  #   Given I am on "about"
  #   Then I should see "Arcade on the Quad" in the "Content Body" region
