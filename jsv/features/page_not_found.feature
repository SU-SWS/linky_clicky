Feature: Page not Found - 404
  In order to ensure that the Jumpstart website Page not found content is visible
  As an end user
  I want to check for the existence of the page

  @javascript
  Scenario: Check content of the custom 404 page
    Given I am on "purple-monkey-dishwasher"
    Then I should see "Oops" in the "Content Body" region
    And I should see the link "Homepage" in the "Content Body" region
    And I should see the link "Search this site..." in the "Content Body" region
    When I click "Homepage"
    Then I should be on the homepage
    When I move backward one page
    And I click "Search this site..."
    Then I should be on "search/node"
